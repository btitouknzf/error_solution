VagrantでゲストのOSを入れ替えてVMを作成しようとしているのですが、エラーが出ます。

    default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:11020
    default: SSH username: vagrant
    default: SSH auth method: private key
Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that
Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.

If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.

If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
as well.

If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.

また、vagrant portコマンドで以下のエラーを出力

There are errors in the configuration of this machine. Please fix
the following errors and try again:

vm:
* A box must be specified.
* Forwarded port definitions require a "host" and "guest" value
* Ports to forward must be 1 to 65535
* Ports to forward must be 1 to 65535
* Ports to forward must be 1 to 65535

* Ports to forward must be 1 to 65535
* Ports to forward must be 1 to 65535
* Ports to forward must be 1 to 65535

shell provisioner:
* Shell provisioner `args` must be a string or array.

OSは、export CREATE_VAGRANT_OS_VER="centos7"で指定し、vagrant-env.shでVAGRANT_MACHINE_BOX_URLを書き換えています。
（centos-7.2-x86_64-virtualbox-puppet-1.0.1.box⇒ネットから持ってきたvagrant-centos-7.3.box）

このエラーについてご存知の方原因を教えていただけないでしょうか？
